# Setting up the IntelliJ IDE

We will be using IntelliJ IDEA to do our development work. An IDE is an Integrated Development Environment - this is an application that provides a code editor, a debugger, and other features - and generally makes lives easier.

## Setting up the IDE

We will be using the community edition, which can be downloaded for free here:

[Windows](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/#section=windows)
[MacOS](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/#section=mac)

### OSX Installation
    1. Navigate to where you saved the download, and open the file.
On MacOS, this box will appear:
![ide-install](assets/intellij-setup/ide-install.png)

    2. Simply drag the icon into the Applications folder, this will complete the installation and should only take a few seconds.

    3. After this, double-click the IntelliJ IDEA CE icon (This can be found via Launchpad on Mac).

    This dialog box may appear, continue by clicking "Open".

### Windows Installation
    1. Navigate to where you saved the download, and run the ``.exe`` file.

    2. Go through the installation wizard, the default settings will be more than fine for our use case.

    3. After this, start IntelliJ IDEA CE from the desktop icon or the start menu.
