# Setting up the IntelliJ IDE

We will be using IntelliJ IDEA to do our development work. An IDE is an Integrated Development Environment - this is an application that provides a code editor, a debugger, and other features - and generally makes lives easier.

## Setting up the IDE

We will be using the community edition, which can be downloaded for free here:

[Windows](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/#section=windows)
[MacOS](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/#section=mac)

![ide-download](assets/intellij-setup/ide-download.png) <!-- .element height="50%" width="50%" -->

Click download, and save the file:
![ide-download2](assets/intellij-setup/ide-download2.png) <!-- .element height="50%" width="50%" -->

Navigate to where you saved the download, and open the file.
On MacOS, this box will appear:
![ide-install](assets/intellij-setup/ide-install.png) <!-- .element height="50%" width="50%" -->

Simply drag the icon into the Applications folder, this will complete the installation and should only take a few seconds.

After this, double-click the IntelliJ IDEA CE icon (This can be found via Launchpad on Mac).

This dialog box may appear, continue by clicking "Open".
![ide-install2](assets/intellij-setup/ide-install2.png) <!-- .element height="50%" width="50%" -->

Click "Do Not Import Settings" and then OK.
![ide-settings](assets/intellij-setup/ide-settings.png) <!-- .element height="50%" width="50%" -->

Now, you can choose which colour style you want. (I prefer Darcula)
[ide-settings2](assets/intellij-setup/ide-settings2.png) <!-- .element height="50%" width="50%" -->

Then click "Next: Keymaps".

Select the "I've never used IDEA before" option
[ide-settings3](assets/intellij-setup/ide-settings3.png) <!-- .element height="50%" width="50%" -->

Then click "Next: Launcher Script".

Leave the box unchecked, and click "Next: Default Plugins"
[ide-settings4](assets/intellij-setup/ide-settings4.png) <!-- .element height="50%" width="50%" -->

We can leave these options as they are, and click through to "Next: Featured Plugins"
[ide-settings5](assets/intellij-setup/ide-settings5.png) <!-- .element height="50%" width="50%" -->

We can also leave these options, and can finally click "Start using IntelliJ IDEA"!

## IntelliJ Projects

After setting up, you should now see this screen:
[ide-project](assets/intellij-setup/ide-project.png) <!-- .element height="50%" width="50%" -->
