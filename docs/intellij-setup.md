# Setting up the IntelliJ IDE

We will be using IntelliJ IDEA to do our development work. An IDE is an Integrated Development Environment - this is an application that provides a code editor, a debugger, and other features - and generally makes lives easier.

## Setting up the IDE

We will be using the community edition, which can be downloaded for free here:

[Windows](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/#section=windows)
[MacOS](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/#section=mac)

![ide-download](assets/intellij-setup/ide-download.png =300x300)

Click download, and save the file:
![ide-download2](assets/intellij-setup/ide-download2.png =300x300)

Navigate to where you saved the download, and open the file.
On MacOS, this box will appear:
![ide-install](assets/intellij-setup/ide-install.png =300x300)

Simply drag the icon into the Applications folder, this will complete the installation and should only take a few seconds.

After this, double-click the IntelliJ IDEA CE icon (This can be found via Launchpad on Mac).

This dialog box may appear, continue by clicking "Open".

Click "Do Not Import Settings" and then OK.

Now, you can choose which colour style you want. (I prefer Darcula)

Then click "Next: Keymaps".

Select the "I've never used IDEA before" option

Then click "Next: Launcher Script".

Leave the box unchecked, and click "Next: Default Plugins"

We can leave these options as they are, and click through to "Next: Featured Plugins"
[ide-settings5](assets/intellij-setup/ide-settings5.png =300x300)

We can also leave these options, and can finally click "Start using IntelliJ IDEA"!

## IntelliJ Projects

After setting up, you should now see this screen:
