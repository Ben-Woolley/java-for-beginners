# Lesson 3 - The less basic building blocks of programming

## Exercise
Your first challenge is to complete a classic "FizzBuzz" question used to test if a software developer can actually develop software.
> Write a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100. But for multiples of three print "Fizz" instead of the number and for the multiples of five print "Buzz". For numbers which are multiples of both three and five print "FizzBuzz".
