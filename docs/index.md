## What is Java?
Java is one of the most popular programming languages used today.  
It is:
* Object-oriented - You have objects of certain types, that have properties and ways to interact with those properties.
* Class-based - You define the blueprints for objects before you create them.

Java is designed to run everywhere by use of the Java Virtual Machine (JVM). The JVM is written to run on most machines, and Java is compiled (converted) to a language that runs on the JVM. **Write Once, Run Anywhere** is one of the biggest advantages of Java.

Because Java is used everywhere, it's used for many things. It is used across Expedia Inc. for most of the functionality of our websites. It has also been used to write:
* Simulations
* Video games
* Development tools (like the one we'll be using)
* Android apps (In a sense, they use the same language, but Android doesn't use the JVM)
