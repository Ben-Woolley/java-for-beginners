# Welcome to Java for Beginners

## Table of Contents
### Setup
We're going to do this together in lesson 1 to make sure we're all ready to go.  
For this course we are going to install:

* [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
* [The Java 8 JDK (Java Development Kit)](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html)
* [IntelliJ IDEA Community Edition](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download)
([Setup Guide](intellij-setup.md))

We're then going to use git to **clone** (take a copy of) the course project which we can add to [from here](https://github.com/Ben-Woolley/java-for-beginners).  
After we have our local copy all that's left to do is import it into IntelliJ.
