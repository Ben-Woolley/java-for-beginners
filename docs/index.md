# Welcome to Java for Beginners

### Setup
We're going to do this together in lesson 1 to make sure we're all ready to go.  
For this course we are going to install:

* [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
* [The Java 8 JDK (Java Development Kit)](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html)
* [IntelliJ IDEA Community Edition](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/#section=mac)
([Setup Guide](intellij-setup.md))

We're then going to use git to **clone** (take a copy of) the course project which we can add to [from here](https://github.com/Ben-Woolley/java-for-beginners).  
After we have our local copy all that's left to do is import it into IntelliJ ([Setup Guide](PokemonSetUp.md)).

## What is Java?
Java is one of the most popular programming languages used today.  
It is:
* Object-oriented - You have objects of certain types, that have properties and ways to interact with those properties.
* Class-based - You define the blueprints for objects before you create them.

Java is designed to run everywhere by use of the Java Virtual Machine (JVM). The JVM is written to run on most machines, and Java is compiled (converted) to a language that runs on the JVM. **Write Once, Run Anywhere** is one of the biggest advantages of Java.

Because Java is used everywhere, it's used for many things. It is used across Expedia Inc. for most of the functionality of our websites. It has also been used to write:
* Simulations
* Video games
* Development tools (like the one we'll be using)
* Android apps (In a sense, they use the same language, but Android doesn't use the JVM)
